This program is a Python script that uses the Fernet encryption method from the cryptography library to encrypt all files in a given directory. After that, the encrypted files are restored back to their original place. In addition, the malware creates a ransom letter, which is saved as a text file in the target directory, demanding payment in Bitcoin for the decryption key.

# DO NOT RUN THE PROGRAM ON YOUR OWN MACHINE. USE A VIRTUAL MACHINE WHEN TESTING!!!!
